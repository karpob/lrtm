--- model.jup_test 
contains the altitude-dependent temperature and pressure profiles, together with
abundances of H2, He, H2O, CH4, NH3, PH3.

--- cldden.jup_test
contains cloud densities for NH3-H2O solution, H2O ice, NH4SH solid, NH3 ice, 
H2S ice

--- mixrat.jup_test
contains mole fractions of the variety of species in the atmosphere, together 
with the changes to their mixing ratios that happen as the clouds condense out.

--- thermal.jup_test
contains model inputs together with the basics calculated from the model, such
as lapse rates, heat capacity of the atmosphere and H2, mean mass, concentration 
of NH3 & H2S in the solution, and fraction of ortho-para hydrogen used in 
calculation.
